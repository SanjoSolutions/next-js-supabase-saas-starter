# Getting Started with Claude Code

This guide is for non-technical entrepreneurs who want to build a SaaS product using Claude Code as their AI developer. No coding experience required.

## What Is Claude Code?

Claude Code is an AI coding assistant that runs in your terminal or Visual Studio Code. You describe what you'd like to be built in plain natural language, and it writes the code, runs commands, and builds your app for you.

## Prerequisites

1. **Claude Code** installed on your computer — [Install guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview)
2. **Docker Desktop** installed and running — [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## Start Claude Code with Your Idea

Create a folder for your project.
Open your terminal, switch to your project folder (`cd <FOLDER>`) and run `claude` to start Claude Code. Then give it a prompt like this:

```
I'd like to build a SaaS for [describe your idea].
Please use https://github.com/SanjoSolutions/next-js-supabase-saas-starter as a starter.
Clone the repository.
```

Claude Code will clone the starter project and begin setting things up. From here, you can keep describing what you want in plain natural language, and Claude Code will make the changes for you.
